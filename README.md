# Vinkelkampen
Repository for the soon to be world famous game Vinkelkampen.

## Background
In the dungeons known as HC-källaren, quite close to Tronen, a game emerged through a lack of motivation to study for exams.
The game was simple yet exciting and led to many laughters. This app takes the game into the digital era for more people to enjoy.

## Rules for playing with pen and paper
The foundation of the game is to test the participants skill in measuring angles using only their naked eyes.
One participant (here called the “Drawer”) draws an angle on a piece of paper (two intersecting lines), where it is clear which angle that is subject to be guessed upon.
With some sort of countdown present the angle is revealed for the other participants. They should now write down their guess on a piece of paper before the countdown ends. The Drawer does not guess on the angle he/she drew.

When the countdown has ended the Drawer measures the angle and reveals the result. The other participants will now get their score from the formula: `score = |measured angle – particiapnt guess|`. The score will be added to previous guesses.
When all scores have been calculated a new round begins and the Drawer will be another participant.

The game does not have a decided number of turns before ending, but it needs to be even with respect to the number of participants, so that all participants draws the angle equal amounts of rounds. 

The winner is the participant with the lowest score.

## Rules for playing with app
The rules are pretty much the same as playing with pen and paper, however there is one clear advantage of using the app. It has got and angle generator that draws random angles. With this all participants can guess on every angle and the app takes the permanent role as Drawer.
